==================
In this exercise, we built 10 different recursive function.

The functions in ex7:

Part A:
* "print_to_n" - Gets an int 'n'. If n is bigger then 0, the function will
print all the numbers from 1 to n, every number in a different line.
* "print_reversed" - Gets an int 'n'. If n is bigger then 0, the function will
print all the numbers from 1 to n when the numbers are going down. every number
is printed in a different line.
* "is_prime" - Gets a number and return True if it's a prime number, and
False if it's not prime. This function uses the function
"has_divisor_smaller_then" to check if n is divided by a number between 1 to
(n**0.5+1).
* "exp_n_x" - Gets 2 numbers, 'n' - int and 'x' - float.By using the
"factorial" function, It returns the exponential sum function of (n, x), an
approximation for e^x.

Part B:
* "play_hanoi" - Solve the game 'Towers of Hanoi'.
The function gets the graphic object - 'hanoi', the number of discs - 'n', the
rod that the discs will be on when the game begin - 'src', the rod that the
discs will be on at the end of the game - 'dest', and the third rod - 'temp'.
* "print_sequences" - Gets a list of different characters - 'char_list and a
number -'n'. The function will print all the combinations of the characters in
the list that their length is n (with repetition).
* "print_no_repetition_sequences" - Gets a list of different characters -
'char_list and a number -'n'. The function will print all the combinations of
the characters in the list that their length is n without repetition.
* "parentheses" - Gets a number, and by using "help_parentheses", returns a
list of all the mathematically legal combinations of n pairs of parentheses.
* "up_and_right" - Gets two numbers - 'n' is the number of steps to the right,
and 'k' is the numbers of steps up. The function prints all the optional ways
to go from the point (0,0) to the point (n,k) when every step can be only up or
right.
* "flood_fill" - Gets an image -  list of sub-lists of stars and dots, and a
start point. The function will change every point in the image that you can
reach from the start point without passing on stars, to a star.
